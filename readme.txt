A theme-agnostic plugin for preventing the "stupid" shaking effect on the login form. (Well *we* don't like it.)

== Description ==

Do you, like we do at Perfect Zero Labs, hate that shaking effect when you enter the wrong credentials on WordPress'
login page? Ever wish you could turn it off for good, without having to dig into your WordPress theme's code?

You see, the usual solution is to add a few lines of code to your WordPress theme's
functions.php... but if you use more than one theme on your site, you'd have to repeat the process. (And that's assuming
the code is readable in the first place!)

The Stop Stupid Shake plugin is a theme-agnostic solution for disabling this annoying built in behaviour, regardless of
which theme you use. Just install and activate the plugin, and the shaking effect on the login page should be gone.

At the end of the day, we think the error message - outlined with a red border - is more than enough to indicate that
something went wrong.

== Installation ==

It couldn't be easier.

1. Upload `stop-stupid-shake.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
